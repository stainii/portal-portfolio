[![Build Status](https://server.stijnhooft.be/jenkins/buildStatus/icon?job=portal-portfolio/master)](https://server.stijnhooft.be/jenkins/job/portal-portfolio/job/master/)

A public portfolio of my work. You can find it on [stijnhooft.be](https://www.stijnhooft.be).

## Integration with the other portal modules
The goal is to integrate this with a personal knowledge base. 
Articles can be written privately and - if fine-tuned and polished - can be published on the portfolio's blog.
